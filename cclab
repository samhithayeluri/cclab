Use Amazon S3 to create bucket and upload objects.
To use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to create a bucket and upload objects,
follow these steps:
1. Sign in to AWS and open S3 Dashboard
➔ Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
➔ From the AWS Management Console, navigate to the S3 dashboard.
2. Create a Bucket
➔ Enter a globally unique name for your bucket (S3 bucket names must be unique across
all AWS accounts).
➔ Choose the AWS region where you want to create the bucket.
➔ Configure optional settings like versioning, logging, and tags.
➔ Click "Create" to create the bucket.
3. Upload Objects
➔ In the bucket you just created, click the "Upload" button to upload objects.
➔ Click "Add files" or "Add folder" to select the files or folders you want to upload.
➔ Configure settings such as permissions and metadata for the uploaded objects.
➔ Click "Upload" to start the upload process.
4. Manage Objects
➔ After uploading objects, you can manage them within the S3 bucket.
➔ You can set permissions, configure lifecycle policies, and organize objects into folders
(known as "prefixes" in S3).
5. Access Objects
➔ To access objects in your S3 bucket, click on the object's name in the S3 dashboard.
➔ You'll see a URL that you can use to access the object via a web browser or
programmatically through APIs.
6. Set Bucket Policies
➔ If you want to control access to your bucket and objects further, you can configure
bucket policies.
➔ Bucket policies allow you to define fine-grained permissions for different users or
applications.
7. Configure Cross-Region Replication
➔ If you need to replicate your data to another AWS region for redundancy or compliance
purposes, you can set up cross-region replication.
8. Monitor and Manage
➔ Regularly monitor your S3 bucket for usage, billing, and access patterns.
➔ Use AWS CloudWatch and other AWS services for monitoring and alerting.
